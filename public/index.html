<!-- the public folder is for files that are used on the browser -->
<!-- yes, we'll use JSX files but those aren't used on the browser so we'll compile those into scripts that can be used on the browser-->

<!-- this is where we need to put in the code -->
<!-- - but how do we get our code in here if we can’t import JSX files here?
    - we convert them all to a single JS file that the browser can read
        - we do this w/ the tools we downloaded earlier -->

        <!-- all we need to do is compile all this code into main.js so it actually works on the browser -->
        <!-- to compile it we need to setup settings in package.json; we tell our tools to do stuff so we compile it  -->
        <!-- we add a script in package.json -->
